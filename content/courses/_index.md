Below is a list of the courses I have been assisting in. In the Winter semester 2021, I received a student evaluation of 1.4 (on a scale 1 "very good" to 5 "poorly") for teaching the tutorial for the lecture _Corporate Finance_. You can download the detailed evaluation (in German only) {{< staticref "pdf/Evaluation-Corporate Finance-Winter2021.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}}.
