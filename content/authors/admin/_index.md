I am a Doctoral candidate at the University of Bremen. My primary research fields are behavioral economics and the economics of digitization. I am specifically interested in exploring the economic implications of digital transformation, with a focus on platforms, regulation, and welfare. Methodologically, I usually work with observational data and conduct online, laboratory, and field experiments.
