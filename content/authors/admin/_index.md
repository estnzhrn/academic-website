I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Bremen. My primary research fields are behavioral economics and industrial organization. I am specifically interested in exploring the economic implications of digital transformation, with a focus on digital platforms, regulation, and welfare. 

Currently, I am visiting the [Department of Microeconomics and Public Economics](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/department-microeconomics-and-public-economics) at Maastricht University.
