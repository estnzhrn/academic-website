I am a PhD candidate at the [Faculty of Business Studies and Economics](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/wiwi) at the [University of Bremen](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/). My research interests include behavioral economics, industrial organization, and regulation. I am interested in better understanding the economic challenges arising from the digital transformation, in order to identify and anticipate necessary public policy and regulatory actions. Methodologically, I usually work with observational data and conduct online, laboratory, and field experiments.

In March 2023, I will be visiting the [Department of Microeconomics and Public Economics](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/department-microeconomics-and-public-economics) at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/).

I am on the Economic Job Market during the 2022/2023 academic year. Click {{< staticref "pdf/Lock-in-effects-in-olms.pdf" "newtab" >}}here{{< /staticref >}} for my job market paper.
