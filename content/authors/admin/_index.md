I am a Doctoral candidate at the University of Bremen. My primary research fields are behavioral economics and industrial organization. I am specifically interested in exploring the economic implications of digital transformation, with a focus on competition, regulation, and welfare. Methodologically, I usually work with observational data and conduct online, laboratory, and field experiments. 

In January 2024, I am going to start a position as Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Department of Digital Economy](https://www.zew.de/en/research-at-zew/digital-economy#) at ZEW.
